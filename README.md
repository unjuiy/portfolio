# portfolio
This is portfolio, which is the result collection of my entire programming life.


[Python Courses] are the final assignments of Python course.
Those certifications of Python programming issued by SIM Global Education.

[Hackathon] is the code for our project, a restaurant recommendation platform using machine learning.
I constructed content-based filtering, one of the recommendation systems, using gradient descent.
Dataset is TripAdvisor's reviews of Singapore restaurants.
Collaborative filtering was also considered, but the hackathon period was short, so it had to be stopped at the concept stage.
This hackathon is the Virtual Hackathon: Singapore's Next E-Commerce Unicorn issued by GDEXA and SIM Global Education.


[UOL Assignment] is a collection of my university assignments.

[ST2195, Programming] covers the main principles of computer programming with a focus on data science applications by following the entire pathway from raw data to databases, data wrangling and visualisation, machine learning frameworks up to software development.

[ST3189, Machine Learning] covers a wider range of such model based and algorithmic machine learning methods, illustrated in various real-world applications and datasets. At the same time, the theoretical foundation of the methodology is presented is some cases.

[ST2187, Business Analytics] extends and reinforces existing knowledge and introduces new areas of interest and applications of modelling in the ever-widening field of management.
