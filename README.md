This is portfolio, which is the result collection of my entire programming life.

UOL Assignment is a collection of my university assignments.
[ST2195, Programming] covers the main principles of computer programming with a focus on data science applications by following the entire pathway from raw data to databases, data wrangling and visualisation, machine learning frameworks up to software development.

[ST3189, Machine Learning] covers a wider range of such model based and algorithmic machine learning methods, illustrated in various real-world applications and datasets. At the same time, the theoretical foundation of the methodology is presented is some cases.


[ST2187, Business Analytics] extends and reinforces existing knowledge and introduces new areas of interest and applications of modelling in the ever-widening field of management.
